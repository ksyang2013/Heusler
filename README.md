# Heusler

## Section 1

A collection of POSCARs for the predicted thermodynamically stable 363 full Heusler (X2YZ) compounds and 134 half Heusler (XYZ) compounds from large-scale ab-initio calculations. All these data were published in the below research article, and please consdier citing it when using these POSCARs in any forms.

## Section 2
A collection of POSCARs for the screened thermodynamically stable 776 quaternary Heusler compounds with magnetic moments large than 0.2 Î¼B (absolute values) from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD). For more detailed data, including convex hull distance, formation energy, lattice parameters, spin moment, and magnetic type, please refer to the research article mentioned below (see supplementary table). The magnetic ground states were determined through high-throughput ab-initio calculations. When utilizing these POSCARs in any form, kindly consider citing the research article and OQMD as the data source.
