#Section 1

A collection of POSCARs for the predicted thermodynamically stable 363 full Heusler (X2YZ) compounds and 134 half Heusler (XYZ) compounds from large-scale ab-initio calculations. All these data were published in the below research article, and please consdier citing it when using these POSCARs in any forms.
